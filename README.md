Idea
----

I am thinking of building a simplified pixel MMORPG, where the moves of all players and objects on the map occur on-chain.

In the center of the map is a gold mine, which mints in-game currency (gold) every second to anyone who stands nearby. With the gold, you can buy in-game weapons or exchange it for ether and vice versa. This way, players have a financial motivation to play: if you make it to the center of the map and kill the other players standing at the gold mine, all the minting will be distributed to you.

There are also portals on the map which can take you home or to another location on a different chain.
